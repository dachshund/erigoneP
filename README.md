### The Erigone model checker with the Pomegranate compiler

I am saving [the erigoneP branch](https://erigone.googlecode.com/svn/branches/erigoneP/)
of [the Erigone model checker](https://code.google.com/p/erigone/) because
it features the Pomegranate compiler that I wrote as my
[Master's thesis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~tk883/research/pomegranate.pdf).
